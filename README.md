**MokeSell Website**
This project aims to create a marketplace meant for only selling mobile phones consumer to consumer. Selling your second-hand phones has never been easier ever since
the introduction of Mokesell. Mokesell eases consumer's process of selling their beloved phones by being a dedicated marketplace for second or used phones while
promoting consumer to consumer sale removing the middle person and not taking any profits the seller receives from the buyer.



**Design Process**
Provide us insights about your design process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory) Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.
